## **1. Project Title**

**Lifestyle and Sleep Quality Analysis**

---

## **2. Problem Statement**

People experience poor sleep quality, stress, and irregular lifestyles, but the key factors influencing these outcomes are not clearly understood.
This project analyzes lifestyle data to identify patterns that affect sleep quality and overall health.

---

## **3. Objectives**

1. Analyze sleep duration and sleep quality.
2. Examine the relationship between stress, physical activity, and health.
3. Identify common sleep disorders and their patterns.
4. Provide insights that can help improve lifestyle habits.

## **4. Dataset Description**

The dataset contains the following variables:

* Age
* Gender
* Occupation
* Sleep Duration
* Quality of Sleep
* Stress Level
* Physical Activity
* BMI Category
* Heart Rate
* Blood Pressure
* Daily Steps
* Sleep Disorder

---

## **5. Tools Used**
Microsoft excel
* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations

---

## **6. Methodology**

1. Load the dataset into Python.
2. Clean data (split blood pressure, convert numeric fields).
3. Perform exploratory analysis.
4. Visualize key relationships (sleep, stress, activity, BMI).
5. Interpret results and generate insights.

---

## **7. Key Analysis Questions**

* What is the average sleep duration?
* Does stress level affect sleep quality?
* Which occupations have the highest stress?
* What are the most common sleep disorders?
* How does physical activity relate to daily steps?

---

## **8. Visualizations**

* Sleep duration by occupation
* Stress vs sleep duration
* Sleep disorder counts
* Correlation heatmap

---

## **9. Insights (Examples)**

* Higher stress is linked to lower sleep quality.
* Physical activity increases daily steps and overall health.
* Sleep apnea is more common among overweight and obese categories.

---

## **10. Conclusion**

The project provides clear evidence that lifestyle factors such as stress, physical activity, and BMI significantly influence sleep quality and health indicators.
